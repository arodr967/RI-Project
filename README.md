###Part 1###

*Using Windows for this project.*

The only difficult part about this was resizing and compressing the images. I was having trouble running the grunt commands because I kept getting this error:

![error](error.PNG)

This was happening because I was running the command on git bash. The solution was to run this on the command prompt instead.
